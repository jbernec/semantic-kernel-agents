      "\n",
      "1. **Expanding Play 3 Overview:**\n",
      "   - **Definition:** Play 3 focuses on minimizing resource use, expanding access to carbon-free electricity, and supporting local communities. \n",
      "   - **Context:** AI operations utilize resources such as energy and water. To achieve a net-zero and nature-positive future, AI operations must align with global sustainability goals. This includes minimizing resource use in AI infrastructure and supporting the decarbonization of local energy grids that datacenters depend on.\n",
      "   - **Updates in 2023:**\n",
      "     - It was recognized that minimizing datacenter resource usage alone is insufficient.\n",
      "     - The updated objectives include greater efforts to enhance access to carbon-free electricity and positively impact the local communities where datacenters operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Insights and Challenges (Page 20 and Page 4):**\n",
      "   - **Electricity Demand:** Datacenters currently account for about 1.0-1.5% of global electricity demand, with most usage linked to non-AI applications.\n",
      "   - **Growth Projections:**\n",
      "     - The International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates datacenters and AI will constitute a small percentage of the global growth in electricity demand through 2030.\n",
      "     - However, growth might be concentrated regionally. For example, Ireland and Denmark are projected to see 20% of the increase in datacenter electricity demand in the near term.\n",
      "   - Addressing the rapid growth in certain regions is essential to avoid straining local electricity grids while promoting sustainability.\n",

      "- The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that **datacenters and AI** will account for a **relatively small share of global electricity demand growth by 2030**. \n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Datacenter Growth Projections (2023-2030):**\n",
      "   - Datacenters currently account for 1.0-1.5% of global electricity demand.\n",
      "   - The IEA projects that, globally, datacenters and AI will remain a small portion of electricity demand growth through 2030.\n",
